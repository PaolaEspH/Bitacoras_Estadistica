abstract = {El año 2012 se reportaron alrededor 19.500 accidentes en las zonas urbanas de la Región Metropolitana, Chile, de los cuales el 16% corresponde a accidentes en autopistas urbanas. Estos accidentes viales ocurren en distintas condiciones o Estados de Tráfico. Por condición o Estado de Tráfico se entiende una combinación única entre flujo, densidad y velocidad que determinan la operación de una vía. La finalidad de esta investigación es determinar la influencia que los Estados de Tráfico en autopistas tienen sobre la ocurrencia y severidad de los accidentes. Por severidad se consideran dos dimensiones: la severidad según daños personales (DP) y la disrupción en el tráfico (DT), usando la cantidad de pistas bloqueadas como proxy para DT. Para este estudio se usó información de accidentes viales, flujos y velocidades instantáneas de circulación en Autopista Central, ubicada en Santiago de Chile, más un conjunto de variables de control relacionadas con la geometría y el clima. Por medio del algoritmo k-means Clustering, se definieron cuatro Estados de Tráfico usando las velocidades recolectadas por espiras magnéticas en la autopista, como una cantidad óptima.Parte de la metodología de trabajo considera la calibración de un modelo de elección discreta logit a partir de datos reales, donde la ocurrencia (o no) de accidentes constituyen las alternativas, utilizando un muestreo de tipo Caso-Control. Los Estados de Tráficos se mostraron ser significativos, afectando la probabilidad de ocurrencia y severidad de los accidentes. Se concluye que los Estados de Tráfico de transición de velocidades desde altas a bajas o viceversa, son los que muestran un mayor riesgo en comparación con estados donde la velocidad se mantiene constante siendo alta o baja. Con estos resultados, es posible la formulación de estrategias de mejor asistencia o prevención de accidentes que los operadores pueden considerar evaluar para su posterior implementación.},

abstract = {This study performs a comprehensive analysis of the effect of different environmental, demographic and vehicle variables on the severity of two-vehicle crashes. The limitations associated with previous studies have been addressed by using a large crash database, properly defining the independent variables, using an appropriate statistical model, and by considering the effect of factors normally unaccounted for such as crash type, DUI involvement, impact speed and height incompatibilities between the two vehicles. The use of a multinomial logit model provides the flexibility to evaluate variables that have opposing effects at different injury levels (such as airbag availability). An innovative linear crash cost model is also used to estimate the effect of the independent variables in terms of dollars. This simplification is particularly useful when discussing potential policy treatments for improving road safety with transportation officials, politicians and other decision makers. The findings from the two models are consistent and suggest that the type of crash has a great impact on severity. Age is the most significant demographic variable, with children being least likely to be injured, and older occupants being most likely to be injured. Occupant behavior also seems to be critical, as the use of seatbelts, and alcohol involvement, greatly decrease or increase, respectively, the severity of the crash. Heavier vehicles increase the safety of its occupants but decrease the safety of occupants of the other vehicle. Vehicle types are not found to be as significant as weight, with the notable exception of pickups, which are at the same time more crashworthy and more aggressive than passenger cars.},

OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern of injuries among non-fatal cases of road traffic accidents. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nagpur, a city in central India. PARTICIPANTS: 423 non-fatal cases of road traffic accidents reporting for treatment to Indira Gandhi Medical College, Nagpur during 1999-2000. STUDY VARIABLES: Demographic characteristics, accident characteristics. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Percentages, proportions, Chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of total 423 subjects, 363 (85.8%) were male while only 60 (14.2%) were female subjects. Majority of the victims (75%) were in the age group 18- 37 years. Sideways collision was the most common type of accident seen in 269 (63.59%) cases. Two wheelers and LMV were the common vehicle being involved in accidents (69.97%) and these accidents were almost equally distributed in both half of the day. Fracture of the bones was the common injury afflicted to the victims followed by multiple injuries like blunt injury, abrasions and lacerations. Lower extremity was involved in 192 (45.39%) cases while multiple sites were affected in 114 (26.95%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the fractures were the commonest injury among the victims of non-fatal road traffic accidents.}

A total of 2,405 major transit bus collisions were reported in 2002 and 2003 that resulted in more than $15 million in property damage, 145 fatalities, and more than 8,000 injuries. According to the NTD, front and angle transit collisions yielded higher fatality and injury rates and property damage costs compared to rear collisions. Most major bus collisions occurred in benign conditions such as clear weather and on dry roads. Therefore, emphasis should be placed on developing a warning system with the capability of continuously monitoring the bus surroundings and providing timely alerts to transit operators about crash threats in front and on either side of the bus.}

This review examines the epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of disability due to car crashes, published between 1980 and 2002. Studies of sequelae limited to specific domains (e.g. head injury, whiplash, psychiatric morbidity) were excluded. Of the 19 studies meeting the criteria for review, most focused on the prevalence of disability following crashes but not the association between them. Prevalence estimates of post-crash disability varied from 2 to 87%. The potential sources of heterogeneity included differences in study settings and period, duration of follow-up, and definitions of exposure and outcome. Methodological problems that compounded the difficulties in interpretation and generalisability of study findings included selection biases and use of non-representative samples, idiosyncratic outcome measures, inadequate adjustment for confounding, and the prevailing medico-legal or compensation context. The findings highlight the need for well-designed population-based epidemiological studies using validated outcome measures and appropriate comparison groups to determine the independent risk of disability due to car crashes. The review also revealed a critical need for data from low- and middle-income countries, the setting for over 90% of the estimated global burden of road traffic injury.}

abstract = {Given the recent advancements in autonomous driving functions, one of the main challenges is safe and efficient operation in complex traffic situations such as road junctions. There is a need for comprehensive testing, either in virtual simulation environments or on real-world test tracks. This paper presents a novel data analysis method including the preparation, analysis and visualization of car crash data, to identify the critical pre-crash scenarios at T- and four-legged junctions as a basis for testing the safety of automated driving systems. The presented method employs k-medoids to cluster historical junction crash data into distinct partitions and then applies the association rules algorithm to each cluster to specify the driving scenarios in more detail. The dataset used consists of 1056 junction crashes in the UK, which were exported from the in-depth “On-the-Spot” database. The study resulted in thirteen crash clusters for T-junctions, and six crash clusters for crossroads. Association rules revealed common crash characteristics, which were the basis for the scenario descriptions. The results support existing findings on road junction accidents and provide benchmark situations for safety performance tests in order to reduce the possible number parameter combinations.}

abstract = {Public transit buses may be considered a safer transportation mode as opposed to others (e.g., private cars). However, safety is a crucial issue regarding transit buses from the perspectives of operators and passengers due to the relevant implications it generates. Therefore, evaluating the accident risk on bus routes provides an opportunity to improve the safety performance of transit operators. Previous research identified patterns of bus accidents and shed light on understanding the effects of many factors regarding frequency and severity of bus accidents. However, no studies have investigated accident risks in bus transit, while considering frequency, severity and exposure factors in a single function. This paper proposes a new methodology for evaluating the accident risk for each transit bus route. At first, the methodology identifies the risk components in terms of frequency, severity and exposure factors that may affect bus accidents. Next, it integrates these terms, to build a risk bus accident function providing a ranking of safety performance for each route. The feasibility of this methodology is demonstrated in a real case study using 3,457 bus accidents provided by a mid-sized Italian bus operator. This experiment shows that transit managers could adopt this methodology to perform an accurate safety analysis on each route. Moreover, this methodology may be implemented in a road traffic safety management system for bus transit operators interested in the monitoring of safety performance, in the evaluation of the risk of accidents on routes, and in the certification process according to recent safety norms.}

Design and setting: Data from a population based case-control study conducted in the Auckland region in 1998/99 was used to examine the adjusted risk of car crash injury or death due to vehicle age, after controlling for a range of known confounders. Cases were all cars involved in crashes in which at least one occupant was hospitalized or killed anywhere in the Auckland region, and controls were randomly selected cars on Auckland roads. The drivers of the 571 case vehicles and 588 control vehicles completed a structured interview. Main outcome measure: Hospitalisation or death of a vehicle occupant due to car crash injury. Results: Vehicles constructed before 1984 had significantly greater chance of being involved in an injury crash than those constructed after 1994 (odds ratio 2.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 6.91), after adjustment for potential confounders. There was also a trend for increasing crash risk with each one year increase in vehicle age after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio 1.05, 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.11; p = 0.09). Conclusion: This study quantifies the increased risk of car crash injury associated with older vehicle year and confirms this as an important public health issue.},

abstract = {Problem: Motor-vehicle accidents are one of the major causes of injury in most motorized countries. Driver distractions have been suggested as a contributor to traffic accidents. Moreover, age of the driver seems to have a role in the relationship between distractions and car crashes. But very few studies have investigated the effect of driver's age on this relationship. This exploratory study investigated the association between distractions, both inside and outside the vehicle, and the increased risk of car crash injury among drivers across different ages. Method: This study used a case series design to analyze data routinely collected by the NSW police in Australia. A special focus of this study was on how drivers' age affects the risk of car crash injury, which was determined by using a well-documented risk estimation methodology. Results: The results obtained indicated that drivers of all ages, on the whole, are more susceptible to distractions inside the vehicle than distractions coming from outside. Age was shown to affect the relationship between in-vehicle distraction and the risk of car crash injury. A separate analysis was also conducted on hand-held phone usage while driving with results supplementing previous findings reported in the literature. Impact to industry: Safety strategies to countermeasure in-vehicle distractions have been suggested and discussed.}

abstract = {Nowadays, product development in the car industry heavily relies on numerical simulations. For example, it is used to explore the influence of design parameters on the weight, costs or functional properties of new car models. Car engineers spend a considerable amount of their time analyzing these influences by inspecting the arising simulations one at a time. Here, we propose using methods from machine learning to semi-automatically analyze the arising finite element data and thereby significantly assist in the overall engineering process. We combine clustering and nonlinear dimensionality reduction to show that the method is able to automatically detect parameter dependent structure instabilities or reveal bifurcations in the time-dependent behavior of beams. In particular we study recent nonlinear and sparse grid approaches, respectively. Our examples demonstrate the strong potential of our approach for reducing the data analysis effort in the engineering process, and emphasize the need for nonlinear methods for such tasks.}

abstract = {To assess the available evidence for a causal role of driver sleepiness in car crashes or car crash injury, and to quantify the effect, a systematic review of the international literature was conducted. The review included all studies with a fatigue-related exposure measure, a crash or crash injury outcome measure and a comparison group, regardless of publication status, language or date of the study. Eighteen cross-sectional studies and one case-control study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The fatigue-related exposures investigated in these studies were sleep disorders (n=14), shift work (n=2), sleep deprivation/fragmentation (n=1), and excessive daytime sleepiness (n=2). Only one study used an injury outcome measure. Studies were limited in their ability to establish a causal relationship by their design, by biases, and in many cases, by small sample sizes. The better quality cross-sectional studies were suggestive of a positive relationship between fatigue and crash risk, but could not provide reliable estimates of the strength of the association. The case-control study provided moderately strong evidence for an association between sleep apnoea and risk of driver injury, with an adjusted odds ratio of 7.2 (95% confidence interval 2.4–21.8). We conclude that the direct epidemiological evidence for a causal role of fatigue in car crashes is weak, but suggestive of an effect. To estimate the burden of injury due to fatigue-related crashes in the population, information is required from well-designed observational epidemiological studies about the prevalence of fatigue in the car driving population and the size of the risk this confers.}
